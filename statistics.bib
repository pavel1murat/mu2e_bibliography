abstract = {The determination of errors on results of experiments with
                  small numbers of events is discussed. Tables of
                  confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution
                  and for the ratio and the difference between small
                  numbers of events are presented. The procedure is
                  checked using Monte Carlo simulation. We re-evaluate
                  the errors on some experimental results already
                  published. The Bayesian statistical approach is
                  adopted.}
